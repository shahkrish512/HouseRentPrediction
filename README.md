# HouseRentPrediction

The real estate market is one of the most price-focused sectors and continues to fluctuate. It is one of the prime sectors to apply the ideas of machine learning.
The dataset has thirteen features. The objective is predicting the rental price for house. 
In this, an attempt has been made to construct a predictive model based on the factors that influence the rental price to determine the rent.
Regression techniques such as Decision Tree regressor, Random Forest regressor, K-nearest Neighbor regressor, Partial Least Square regressor, Gradient Boosting regressor, Ada Boosting regressor and Multilayer Perceptron regressor were applied.
These models are used to build a predictive model, and to pick the best performing model by performing a comparative analysis on their performance score obtained. 
The expected outcomes of the models are measured using performance metrics such as R-square score, Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric.
